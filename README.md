# MCTS and TDTS Game-Playing Agent Tester for 2048
This is the repository for my undergraduate thesis on the comparison of MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) and TDTS (Temporal Difference Tree Search) algorithm's performance on the 2048 game.

The repository is initially copied from my other repository https://github.com/jghjianghan/stunning-2048 made for Graphical Computing course's final assignment.
